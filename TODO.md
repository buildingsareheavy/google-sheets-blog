# TODO LIST

---

### May 6 - Monday

- [ ] Add `beforeRouteEnter` to homepage to stop flash of content for API call.

- [ ] Find out if Airtable has an easy API for forms or if I need to create a `POST` request from axios.

### May 14th - Tuesday

- [ ] Change "add post" / "cancel" so it's not one button.

- [ ] Add a response after the post is submitted. Maybe add a "Your post has been successfully added, refreshing in 5 seconds."
