# TODO LIST

---

### May 6 - Monday

- [ ] Add `beforeRouteEnter` to homepage to stop flash of content for API call or fade them in individually.

- [x] Find out if Airtable has an easy API for forms or if I need to create a `POST` request from axios.

### May 14th - Tuesday

- [x] Change "add post" / "cancel" so it's not one button.

- [x] Add a response after the post is submitted. Maybe add a "Your post has been successfully added, refreshing in 5 seconds."

- [x] Clean up CSS

- [ ] Make loadQuote and postQuote into thier own components.

- [ ] Make buttons thier own components too.

- [ ] Add `stagger` to `getQuotes()`.

- [ ] Add routing for `/submit` and figure out how to stay on homepage but with props working the right way.
